## OS X Bootstrap

Some people call these kind of repos `username/Dotfiles`, but they usually contain a lot more than just Dotfiles.

This repo contains my Dotfiles and command line tools and applications that I have installed on my mac.

### Usage

```shell
git clone git@github.com:kylejm/kylejm-osx-bootstrap.git ~/Developer/kylejm-osx-bootstrap
cd ~/Developer/kylejm-osx-boostrap
make osx
```
